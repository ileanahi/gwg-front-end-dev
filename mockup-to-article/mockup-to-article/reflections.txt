Reflection:

1. What new skills have you learned?
A skill that I've learned is going back to the EDM element reference to see what HTML codes aren't deprecated.

2. What has been easy?
It has been easy learning about the differences between the HTML of the 2000s and the HTML of today. There are still some similarities!

3. What has been difficult?
Not many difficulties too far. But I learned to read the mockups more carefully so that I don't miss any details!

4. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Yes! I looked at MDN to reference which tags to use.
